# Wireless-System-Implementation


 A1: a) Representation of signal in time and frequency domain, observing the effect of sampling frequency. b) Transmission and reconstruction of an image using BPSK, QPSK and 16-QAM. Plotted the constellation diagrams for the same.  
 A2: MATLAB and LabVIEW - Channel encoding using (7, 4) Hamming Code, followed by QPSK/64-QAM, passed through Rayleigh flat fading channel, added AWGN and demodulation.
